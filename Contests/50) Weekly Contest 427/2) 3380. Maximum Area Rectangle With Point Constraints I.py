    # Other solutions:

    # Hint 1: If `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are two opposite corners of a rectangle, then the other two would be
    # `(x1, y2)` and `(x2, y1)`.
    # Hint 2: Fix two points and find the other two using a set data structure.
    # Hint 3: After determining the rectangle, iterate through the array of points to ensure no point lies on the
    # rectangleâ€™s border or within its interior.
