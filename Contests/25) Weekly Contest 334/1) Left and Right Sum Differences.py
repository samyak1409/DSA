    # My Reply:
    # "Few things to remember:
    # 1) The space required for returning the ans, is not counted in the space complexity of the solution.
    # Why? Take the example of the current solution only, here's my python code with exactly the same algorithm with
    # O(1) space:
    # p_sum, s_sum = 0, sum(nums)
    # for num in nums:
    #     s_sum -= num
    #     yield abs(p_sum-s_sum)
    #     p_sum += num
    # Proves kreakEmp's algo is O(1) space.
    # 2) It's always a good practice to not modify the input array, unless we're asked to.
    # Why? Because, in real world, maybe the input array needs to be used somewhere else after it's passed into your
    # function, so, we don't want it to be changed.
    #
    # I hope it helped. ðŸ˜Š
    #
    # EDIT: Just saw you're way more experienced than me, I wonder why did you write that, please correct me if I'm
    # wrong instead."
