    # Explanations on why this algorithm work:
    #
    # "I spent 20 minutes trying to understand this and I turned from "wtf is this code it can't be working" to "holy
    # it's genius". It's so intuitive, though I do think more explanation need to be added here for better
    # understanding.
    # Long story short: i, j is like a moving "memory" sliding frame. (Note: i, j definitely NOT the exact index for the
    # largest range!) Whenever there's a better choice, the span of the frame will fit for the larger range. So you can
    # directly return the final span/length of the frame as the final output.
    # More detailed version: as you can see from the code, j is constantly moving right. k here can be considered as the
    # remaining feasible amount of flips, and reflects the current range (i.e., from i to j). When k<0, it's not a
    # feasible solution and when k>=0, it'll be a feasible solution. If currently range is not yet a feasible solution
    # or better than current "memory" frame (i.e., k<0 judgement) , i will try follow up the j and j-i (the frame size)
    # remains unchanged, keeping the current maximum size intact. Whenever the flip count k of current range (i.e.,
    # still i to j) is greater or equals to 0, it means we can possibly expand our frame, and that's exactly what the
    # code does. (i remains unchanged since it will not go into k<0 clauses, and j keeps moving when k>=0).
    # Eventually, when j comes to the end, the "memory" frame will automatically (by design of course) give us the
    # maximum range throughout the array."

    # "If k < 0, both i, j, will move forward together" <- that's the key!

    # "For everyone who is confused about how this method works like I used to be, here is my explanation of the
    # solution:
    # Take nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3 for example.
    # We know the answer is 10 with subarray from nums[2] to nums[11].
    # Through the iteration of j, this subarray would be found while j = 11 and i = 2.
    # What happens then?
    # Well as we keep iterate j we will find out that j and i keep adding 1 in every iteration, which makes the distance
    # between j and i the same (and is the currently best).
    # The distance between `j` and `i` would change again if there is a longer subarray exist.
    # Try appending more 1s in nums you'll see.
    # In short:
    # We are looking for bigger window size, when we find one, we use this window to iterate till we find a larger one
    # (if any)."
