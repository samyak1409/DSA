    # 1) Optimal (Greedy: Start from Biggest Coin): TC = O(1); SC = O(1)
    # Simple Intuition: If we want to minimize the number of coins, let's take the coins with the highest value first.
    # V.IMP: Why does greedy approach work here, and when will it not? https://youtu.be/mVg9CfJvayM?t=420 ðŸ‘Œ
    # SO, GREEDY APPROACH WOULD WORK EVERYWHERE WHERE IN THE DENOMINATIONS, SUM OF *NO* TWO SMALLER DENOMINATIONS (SAME
    # OR DIFFERENT) IS GREATER THAN ANY BIGGER DENOMINATION.
