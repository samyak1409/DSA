    # Intuition: If we observe examples there is a similarity in paths from start to end.
    # From start to end we need a certain no. of down & right steps i.e. (m-1) & (n-1) respectively.
    # So each time we are taking exactly (m+n-2) steps to reach the end.
    #
    #     Out of total (m+n-2) steps, if we choose total (m-1) down steps or total (n-1) right steps, and calculate the
    #     Combinations (i.e.: C(m+n-2, m-1) or C(m+n-2, n-1)), weâ€™ll get the total number of unique paths.
    #     Why? Not able to understand even after hours of trying :(
    #
    #     Instead understood it like: (Source: https://youtu.be/m7chPc7zIF4)
    #     We have to find all the unique WAYS, so it looks like we have to use Permutations:
    #     We know we have to take exactly (m+n-2) steps, and we got (m-1) down & (n-1) right steps,
    #     so Total Ways = P(m+n-2, (m-1)+(n-1)) = P(m+n-2, m+n-2) = (m+n-2)!
    #     but wait, changing the internal order of down & right steps doesn't matter
    #     i.e. DRR and RRD are different, but DRR and DRR {order of R is opposite} are same.
    #     So removing this: Total Unique Ways = (m+n-2)! / (m-1)!(n-1)!
    #     Which turns out to be the formula of Combinations, N = m+n-2; R = m-1 (or n-1) => (N-R) = n-1 (or m-1)
    #
    # => Total Unique Ways = C(m+n-2, m-1) or C(m+n-2, n-1)
