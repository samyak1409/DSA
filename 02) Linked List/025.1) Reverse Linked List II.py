    # It's Easy, just have to take care of the two different cases in which the algo will be a little different:
    # i) left is not at the start, e.g. (head=[1,2,3,4,5], left=2, right=4)
    # ii) left is at the start, e.g. (head=[1,2,3,4,5], left=1, right=3)

    for _ in range(left-2):  # moving `curr` to the node just before `left`

    # Saving required references:
    before = None

    if left != 1:  # (if `left` is not start of the list)
        before.next = prev  # connecting the node just before `left` to the last node whose pointer was reversed
    else:  # (list reversed right from the beginning)
        head = prev  # => we need to change the `head`, it will be the last node whose pointer was reversed
